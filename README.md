# Energy-Appliances-Prediction


# * Goal

The goal of this project is to make a prediction model which will predict the enery consumption by the appliances based on the given dataset.





# Conclusion
1. The best Algorithm to use for this dataset Extra Trees Regressor

2. The untuned model was able to explain 57% of variance on test set .

3. The tuned model was able to explain 63% of varaince on tese set which is improvement of 10%

4. The final model had 22 features

5. Feature reduction was not able to add to better R2 score
